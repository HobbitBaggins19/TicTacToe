# TicTacToe
Single- and Multiplayer TicTacToe (or Naughts and Crosses) 
To make a move, enter the number of the space you wish to mark. The numbers are given at the start of the first game.
In multiplayer, each player may enter his name in the "Player 1/2's name>>> " prompt, as long as they are different. (Defaults to "Player 1/2")
In singleplayer, no name option is given.
To play singleplayer, enter "1" in the "Number of players>>> " prompt.
To play multiplayer, enter "2" in the "Number of players>>> " prompt.
In multiplayer, each player has his own prompt with his player name.
In singleplayer, Player 2's moves are automatically made, so there is only one prompt.
